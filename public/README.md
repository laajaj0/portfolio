# Public Assets

This folder contains publicly accessible files for your portfolio.

## Resume/CV Files

To add a default resume file:
1. Place your resume PDF here (e.g., `resume.pdf`)
2. The file will be accessible at `/resume.pdf` in your portfolio

**Note:** You can also upload resumes directly through the admin dashboard (Info tab → Resume/CV section), which will store them as base64 data.

## Other Assets

You can place other public assets here like:
- Favicon files
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml
- Any other static files you want to serve
